Note: This repository has all the four labs of Deep Learning subject's source code present except the datasets. Upload the required datasets in the respective folders.

Secondly, in Lab2, the mnist/out and mnist/out_l2 outputs are also not uploaded (due to many output files). Thus, when you run the specific part either way you will have the outputs in your working directory.
